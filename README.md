# Pantry Recipes

Are you ever in the mood to cook a home-made meal and you can only seem to find recipes for which you're missing a couple key ingredients? Pantry Recipes is a personalized recipe finder. The database is dependent on users' contributions. The user can add new recipes, search all recipes in the database, or do a custom search based on the ingredients they have in their pantry. With opportunity in advertisements and potential pro-memberships, the possibilities of growth are endless.

The app begins in a login/register page which then takes you to the home page where you can select to search, look at your account settings, or your recipes. Within the search page, you can filter by your ingredients, what type of food, and what meal of the day you are looking for (breakfast, lunch, dinner). You can also add new recipes in the "my recipes" section.
